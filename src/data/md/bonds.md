# Bond Basics

A bond is a debt investment where investors loan money to corporations or governments for a set term and interest rate. Bonds trade on the over-the-counter market after issuance, with their principal value fluctuating based on changes in interest rates and credit quality.

## Features

Bonds have various features, including:

- **Coupon Rate**: The interest rate paid by the bond, which can be fixed, floating, or inflation-indexed. The coupon date indicates the frequency of interest payments, usually biannually for US bonds.

- **Maturity Date**: The date when the bond principal will be repaid, typically ranging from 1 year to thirty years for bonds.

- **Options**: Bonds may have call features, allowing the issuer to repay the bond before maturity, or put features, allowing the bondholder to force repayment.

- **Sinking Funds**: These are used to retire a bond issue, reducing the risk of default, and enabling lower interest rates.

- **Senior Debt and Subordinated Debt**: Senior debt has priority in case of default, while subordinated debt is unsecured and repaid after other debts.

## Types of Bonds

There are three main issuers of bonds in the US:

1. **Treasury Bonds**: Issued by the US Treasury with various maturity ranges.

   - Bills (up to one year)
   - Notes (one to ten years)
   - Bonds (greater than ten years)

2. **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by corporations, often callable, and carrying credit risk, leading to higher coupon rates.

3. **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by states and localities, with credit risk and potential tax benefits.

Other bond types include zero-coupon bonds, asset-backed securities, high-yield bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).

## Sources of Return

Bond returns come from three sources: return of principal, interest (coupon payments), and interest-on-interest (reinvested coupon payments).

## Risks

Bonds carry several risks, including:

- **Interest Rate Risk**: Bond values fluctuate with interest rates.

- **Credit Risk**: Risk of issuer default.

- **Call Risk**: Risk of early bond repayment.

- **Reinvestment Risk**: Risk of reinvesting at a lower interest rate.

- **Inflation Risk**: Risk of interest not keeping up with inflation.

- **Liquidity Risk**: Risk of not selling the bond without losing value.

## Credit Ratings

Bonds are rated by agencies like Moody's and S&P/Fitch. Ratings range from Aaa (highest) to D (in default).

## Factors Affecting Bond Prices

Bond prices change due to changes in credit ratings and interest rates. Prices rise when rates fall and vice versa.

## Role in a Portfolio

Bonds are used to stabilize portfolios and generate income. The choice between short-term and intermediate-term bonds depends on various factors.

## Taxes

Bond returns are typically fully taxed. Consider tax-efficient strategies when investing in bonds.

## Style Boxes

Style boxes categorize bonds based on credit quality and interest rate sensitivity. They help assess risk and diversification.
